SkillSwap 🚀
Peer-to-Peer Skill Exchange Platform

SkillSwap is a peer-to-peer skill exchange platform built with the vision that every student can be both a learner and a mentor. The platform enables users to teach skills, attend learning sessions, earn credits, and grow together — while maintaining quality through an AI-based mentor eligibility test.

🌟 Key Features
👥 Dual Role System

Every user can act as both:

Learner (attend sessions, learn new skills)

Mentor (teach skills after eligibility approval)

🧠 AI-Based Skill Test (Mentor Eligibility)

Users must take an AI-powered skill assessment

Only users scoring ≥ 75% are eligible to teach that skill

Ensures quality, credibility, and trust in peer learning
